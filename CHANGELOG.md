# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- All message/folder deletion commands, MCP deletion operations, API handlers and deletion permissions. No config can enable them. Use explicit move-to-Trash instead; old deletion configuration keys fail validation.
- Bundled older upstream signed XPIs with full-access deletion code; build this fork rather than installing those stale artifacts.

### Added
- Add-on-enforced JSON access policy shared by CLI and optional MCP: always-on reading/searching, switchable attachment downloads (on by default), draft preparation, and separately gated sending/mailbox operations. XPI builds validate settings and derive native permissions; `tb access` reports the installed policy. Existing installed or signed upstream add-ons are unchanged.

### Fixed
- Attachment downloads reject unsafe filenames and refuse overwrites; XPI builds no longer produce world-writable files.
- MCP validates tool arguments, preserves zero-valued search limits/size bounds, and reports handler errors as tool failures. HTTP clients also reject error payloads returned with status 200.
- Body limits cover HTML, raw messages, and CLI batch results. Native attachment listing includes text/HTML files without appending their contents to the message body.
- Thread lookup consumes all native query pages and surfaces query failures.
- Replies preserve Thunderbird's generated quotation and honor CLI `--html`; new messages use native priority and custom-header fields.
- Bulk move/delete/tag filters run before the limit; already-tagged messages do not consume a tagging batch. Invalid message IDs and operation flags fail explicitly.
- Bridge preserves split UTF-8 input, survives interrupted uploads, prevents replacement of an active extension socket, and fails pending requests on disconnect.
- `sync` no longer reports success without syncing. Folder counts use `getFolderInfo`. Documentation now distinguishes implemented protections from proposed security features; unsupported bridge options fail at startup.
- Bundled skill examples now match real MCP arguments and stop claiming nonexistent sanitization, trust scores, and bulk-archive commands. Bulk move fails closed with older extensions that cannot confirm filtering support.
- Folder listings and recent-message queries sort all matching headers before applying pagination, including across Thunderbird result pages.
- Search tag and size filters are applied by Thunderbird before the result limit, so matching messages beyond the first unfiltered batch are not missed.
- Limited message collection checks for an additional matching message before reporting `hasMore`, including when truncating within the final page, and aborts unfinished message lists. Invalid pagination arguments fail before starting a query.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-14

npm packages `thunderbird-cli`, `thunderbird-cli-bridge`, `thunderbird-cli-mcp` 1.1.0; Thunderbird extension 2.1.0.

### Security
- Bridge rejects requests from web pages in the user's browser: HTTP `Origin` outside `TB_BRIDGE_CORS_ORIGINS`, non-local `Host` headers (DNS rebinding; extend with `TB_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`), and WebSocket handshakes from web origins that could take over the extension slot. Previously a page could blindly `POST /compose` with `send: true`.
- Optional `TB_AUTH_TOKEN` enforcement on the bridge HTTP listener (#21).
- Dependencies patched for all open Dependabot alerts: ws 8.21.3, adm-zip 0.6.1, hono 4.13.7, @hono/node-server 1.19.17, fast-uri 3.1.7, qs 6.16.0, body-parser 2.3.0, ip-address 10.7.0, express-rate-limit 8.7.0.

### Fixed
- `tb thread` returned an empty thread: headers are now parsed from the raw message and Message-IDs queried without angle brackets (#4). Replies matched only by subject are labelled `threadMatch: "subject"`.
- `tb recent --account` and `--unread` were ignored by the extension (#4).

### Changed
- Extension reconnects with backoff (3s → 15s cap) and immediately on return from idle; bridge drops unresponsive extension sockets via ping/pong (#20). Extension now requests the `idle` permission.
- `read-batch`, bulk tag/fetch, folder fetch and thread lookups run with bounded parallelism; attachment base64 encoding is chunked (#20).
- MCP `email_search` accepts filters without a text query (#20).
- `tb health` / `GET /health` reports the loaded extension's real version instead of a fixed "2.0.0".
- Bridge explains a port already in use at startup instead of crashing.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- `server.json` at repo root, enabling submission to the Official MCP Registry (`io.github.vitalio-sh/thunderbird-cli`).
- `mcpName` field in `mcp/package.json` — required by the MCP Registry to match an npm package to a server entry.

### Changed
- npm `keywords` expanded from 6–7 per package to the full 18-item discovery set per DISTRIBUTION-PLAN §2.2 (adds `mcp-server`, `anthropic`, `email-client`, `smtp`, `ai-agent`, `ai-tools`, `agentic`, `automation`, `localhost`, `privacy`).

### No runtime changes
Metadata-only release. No code changes since 1.0.1.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Bridge timeout was hardcoded at 30s**, causing SMTP send operations to fail silently when delivery took longer (typical for Migadu, Protonmail, and other providers with strict outbound checks).
- Bridge now defaults to **120 seconds** and is fully configurable.

### Added
- `TB_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` environment variable on the bridge daemon (default: 120000 ms)
- `X-TB-Timeout` HTTP header for per-request override
- CLI and MCP HTTP clients now propagate their `--timeout` value to the bridge via the new header
- `defaultTimeoutMs` field in `/bridge/status` response (so clients can introspect)
- Automated GitHub Release workflow (attaches signed XPI to version tags) — added in 1.0.0 dev cycle
- `npm run build:xpi` build script for cross-platform XPI packaging — added in 1.0.0 dev cycle
- Demo GIF recording instructions in `assets/README.md` — added in 1.0.0 dev cycle
